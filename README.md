# bloodfeeders
Scope of this mod:
- Add hemogenic xenotypes and other related content
- Potentially rebalance certain aspects of sanguophage to fit around new additions

General sanguophage rebalances should be done by [fried rice](https://github.com/boomersama/boomer.patches) so any additional changes can be built upon by this mod.

## Additions
- Adds succubi and a bloodfeeder-worshipping industrial faction
